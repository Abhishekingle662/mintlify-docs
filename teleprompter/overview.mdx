## Why This Solution? ‚ö°

Our teleprompter combines modern web technologies with native performance to deliver an exceptional user experience.

### Performance That Matters

<Tip>
Tauri produces binaries ~10x smaller than Electron, resulting in faster startup times and lower memory usage.
</Tip>

- **Native Rust backend** means zero-overhead system calls
- React's concurrent rendering keeps UI responsive even during heavy operations
- Smooth 60fps scrolling with customizable WPM (Words Per Minute)

### Real-Time Everything

The application responds instantly to your needs:

- File watcher detects external script changes in **<100ms**
- Global hotkeys work system-wide (no alt-tabbing required)
- Smooth 60fps scrolling for professional delivery

### Cross-Platform Native Feel

<Check>
Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux with a native look and feel on each platform.
