### 4. **Use Cases** (`teleprompter/use-cases.mdx`)
- Content creator workflows (YouTube, Streaming, Podcasting)
- Professional use cases (Interviews, Presentations)
- Corporate applications
- Education and training scenarios
- Creative uses (Theatre, Language learning)
- Practical examples for each use case

### 5. **Technical Challenges** (`teleprompter/technical-challenges.mdx`)
- React Strict Mode double mounting solution

- Cross-platform file path resolution
- Click-through with interaction implementation
- Real-time file watching efficiency
- Lessons learned
- Future technical challenges

## Navigation Structure

Added a new tab: **"Teleprompter Project"** with three groups:

```
Teleprompter Project
├── Introduction
│   └── Overview
├── Technical Documentation
│   ├── Architecture
│   ├── Features
│   └── Technical Challenges
└── Practical Guides
    └── Use Cases
```

## Mintlify Components Used

The documentation leverages the full power of Mintlify components, as learned from the MCP server:

- ✅ `<Card>` and `<CardGroup>` - For feature highlights and use case presentation
- ✅ `<Steps>` - For sequential workflows and tutorials
- ✅ `<Tabs>` - For platform-specific content and alternatives
- ✅ `<Accordion>` and `<AccordionGroup>` - For collapsible detailed information
- ✅ `<CodeGroup>` - For multi-language code examples
- ✅ `<Note>`, `<Tip>`, `<Warning>`, `<Info>`, `<Check>` - For contextual callouts
- ✅ `<Frame>` - For ASCII diagrams and visual representations
- ✅ Proper frontmatter with `title` and `description` on every page
- ✅ Code blocks with language tags and syntax highlighting

## Key Improvements Over Original

1. **Better Organization**: Split monolithic doc into logical, navigable sections
2. **Enhanced Readability**: Used appropriate Mintlify components for visual hierarchy
3. **Interactive Examples**: Code blocks with multiple language options
4. **Professional Presentation**: Consistent formatting following Mintlify best practices
5. **SEO Optimized**: Each page has proper title and description metadata
6. **Developer-Friendly**: Technical details separated from user-facing content

## MCP Server Integration

This entire documentation was created using the **Mintlify MCP Server** which provided:
- Real-time access to Mintlify component documentation
- Best practice guidelines for technical writing
- Component usage examples and patterns
- Proper page structure requirements

## Next Steps

To view the documentation:

```bash
# Navigate to the docs directory
cd d:\App_Dev\mintlify-docs

# Start the local preview
mint dev

# Open browser to http://localhost:3000
```

Then navigate to the **"Teleprompter Project"** tab to see all the new documentation!
