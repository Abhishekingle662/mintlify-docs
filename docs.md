# Building a Real-Time Teleprompter App: From Script Writing to Interview Practice 🎬

As content creators and professionals, we've all been there—struggling to remember our lines during a presentation, stumbling through interview prep, or wishing we had a better way to practice our speeches. That's why I built a cross-platform desktop teleprompter application that combines modern web technologies with native performance.

## The Problem Space 🎯

Traditional teleprompters are either expensive hardware solutions or clunky software that doesn't quite cut it. I wanted something that could:
- **Help content creators** write and rehearse scripts seamlessly
- **Assist interview preparation** with smooth, distraction-free scrolling
- **Provide real-time feedback** on pacing and delivery
- **Work transparently** over any application without disrupting workflow

## The Solution: Modern Architecture Meets Native Performance ⚡

### Tech Stack

**Frontend Layer:**
- **React 19** - Latest React with concurrent features for smooth UI updates
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better developer experience
- **Vite 7** - Lightning-fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement) for development

**Backend Layer:**
- **Tauri 2.0** - Rust-powered desktop framework (smaller, faster, more secure than Electron)
- **Rust** - Memory-safe systems programming for file operations and window management
- **Native Plugins** - Global shortcuts, file system access, and OS-level integrations

**Additional Technologies:**
- **MCP Server (Model Context Protocol)** - For AI-assisted script editing and suggestions
- **Real-time File Watching** - Instant updates when scripts are edited externally
- **MongoDB Integration** - For cloud-based script storage and synchronization

### Why This Stack? 🤔

**1. Performance That Matters**
- Tauri produces binaries ~10x smaller than Electron
- Native Rust backend means zero-overhead system calls
- React's concurrent rendering keeps UI responsive even during heavy operations

**2. Real-Time Everything**
- File watcher detects external script changes in <100ms
- Global hotkeys work system-wide (no alt-tabbing required)
- Smooth 60fps scrolling with customizable WPM (Words Per Minute)

**3. Cross-Platform Native Feel**
- Windows, macOS, and Linux support
- Borderless, transparent overlay mode
- Click-through functionality with Ctrl+click to interact

## Key Features That Make It Shine ✨

### 1. **Intelligent Script Management**
- Built-in file manager with real-time sync
- Auto-loading from scripts directory
- Support for .txt and .md formats
- In-app script editor with maximize mode

### 2. **Professional Teleprompter Experience**
- Continuous and karaoke scroll modes
- Configurable countdown timer
- Focus band highlighting for better readability
- Mirror mode for traditional teleprompter glass setups

### 3. **Workflow-Optimized Controls**
- `Ctrl+Space` - Play/Pause instantly
- `Ctrl+Up/Down` - Adjust speed on the fly
- `Ctrl+[/]` - Brightness control
- `Ctrl+I` - Toggle click-through mode
- `Ctrl+F` - Quick file manager access

### 4. **Customization for Every Use Case**
- Font family and size control
- Margin adjustments (top, bottom, left, right)
- Opacity and blur effects
- Text color customization
- Session persistence across restarts

### Real-Time Data Flow Example:

1. **User edits script externally** (VS Code, Notepad, etc.)
2. **Rust file watcher** detects change via OS event
3. **Event emitted** to frontend via Tauri's event system
4. **React state updates** trigger re-render
5. **UI refreshes** in <100ms - user sees changes instantly

## Use Cases That Inspired Development 💡

### 1. **Content Creator Workflow**
- Write scripts in your favorite editor
- See changes instantly in the teleprompter
- Practice delivery with adjustable speed
- Perfect for YouTube videos, podcasts, and live streams

### 2. **Interview Preparation**
- Load common interview questions
- Practice answers with natural pacing
- Build confidence with countdown timers
- Review and refine responses in real-time

### 3. **Public Speaking & Presentations**
- Transparent overlay over presentation software
- Control speed with keyboard shortcuts
- Focus band keeps you on track
- No more memorization stress

### 4. **Education & Training**
- Instructors can prepare lecture notes
- Students can practice presentations
- Real-time collaboration with file sync
- Accessible across all major platforms

## Technical Challenges & Solutions 🔧

### Challenge 1: React Strict Mode Double Mounting
**Problem:** Global shortcuts were being registered twice, causing "HotKey already registered" errors.

**Solution:** Implemented module-level global flags that persist across component remounts, combined with individual shortcut unregistration before re-registration.

### Challenge 2: Smooth Scrolling Performance
**Problem:** Large scripts (10,000+ words) caused frame drops during continuous scroll.

**Solution:** Used `requestAnimationFrame` for 60fps updates, calculated WPM-based pixel increments, and optimized React re-renders with proper refs.

### Challenge 3: File Path Resolution Across Platforms
**Problem:** Development (src-tauri directory) vs production (project root) had different working directories.

**Solution:** Smart path resolution in Rust that detects current directory and normalizes to project root.

### Challenge 4: Click-Through with Interaction
**Problem:** Needed window to be click-through but still interactive for controls.

**Solution:** Implemented Ctrl+click to temporarily enable interaction, maintaining transparency and overlay behavior.

## What's Next? 🚀

The journey doesn't stop here. Future enhancements include:

- **Cloud Sync** - Access your scripts from anywhere
- **AI-Powered Script Analysis** - Get suggestions for pacing, tone, and delivery
