<Note>
Hello! This page was created using the MCP server integration. The MCP server is now successfully connected and working with your Mintlify documentation project.
</Note>

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a powerful integration that allows AI assistants to access specialized knowledge bases and tools. In this case, we're using the Mintlify MCP server to:

- Access comprehensive Mintlify documentation
- Get real-time guidance on best practices
- Search for component usage examples
- Understand configuration options

## How It Works

<Steps>
<Step title="MCP Server Configuration">
  Your MCP server is configured in `.vscode/mcp.json` and connects to:
  
  ```json
  {
    "url": "https://projectkeystone.mintlify.app/mcp",
    "type": "http"
  }
  ```
  
  <Check>
  The MCP server is successfully connected and responding!
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="AI-Powered Documentation">
  With the MCP server, AI assistants can:
  
  - Search the Mintlify knowledge base
  - Provide accurate component examples
  - Follow documentation best practices
  - Suggest proper page structure
</Step>

<Step title="Enhanced Workflow">
  This integration enables:
  
  - Faster documentation creation
  - Consistent formatting
  - Access to latest features
  - Real-time best practice guidance
</Step>
</Steps>
